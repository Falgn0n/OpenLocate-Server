Currently OpenLocate  supports Android, and allows users to locate their lost devices. Cross platform remote wipe functionality will come in the future.\r\n\r\n> OpenLocate being developed by Henry Hoggard \r\n> for a final year Computer Science dissertation\r\n> at Cardiff University.\r\n> OpenLocate is intended to be used as a privacy conscious replacement \r\n> to iCloud and Google Device Manager. With OpenLocate YOU control your location data,\r\n> rather than placing it in the hands of Google, Apple and consequently even the NSA.\r\n\r\n\r\n![Image](https://i.imgur.com/IHeCAgL.png)\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n0.0.1\r\n\r\nOpenLocate is active development and may be buggy. Many features are still in development, however you can currently track your lost devices with OpenLocate!\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nOpenLocate uses a number of open source projects to work properly, here are a few of the key technologies:\r\n\r\n* [Nodejs] \r\n* [Mongoose]\r\n* [MongoDB]\r\n* [Express]\r\n* [Passportjs]\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nPlease install Nodejs before running the installation:\r\n\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/HenryHoggard/OpenLocate-Server\r\n$ cd OpenLocate-Server\r\n$ npm install\r\n```\r\nAfter you install all the required dependencies. Edit the following file and type a new random session secret:\r\n* [config/secrets.js](https://github.com/HenryHoggard/OpenLocate-Server/blob/master/config/secrets.js)\r\n\r\nYou can then launch the server:\r\n```sh\r\n$ node app.js\r\n```\r\n### SSL\r\n\r\nOpenLocate needs to be configured with SSL to be effective in keeping user data private. Currently only valid signed certificates are accepted by the mobile client. To use SSL please replace the following code in \"app.js\" with the relevant information for your certificates:\r\n```js\r\n https.createServer({\r\n      key: fs.readFileSync('key.pem'),\r\n      cert: fs.readFileSync('cert.pem')\r\n    }, app).listen(4000);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nWant to contribute? \r\n\r\nReport issues or contribute new code.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n----\r\n\r\nGPL-V3\r\n\r\n\r\nLinux Build\r\n[![Linux Status](https://travis-ci.org/HenryHoggard/OpenLocate-Server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/HenryHoggard/OpenLocate-Server)\r\n\r\nWindows Build\r\n[![Windows status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/na5b5k29e6klw6l0?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/HenryHoggard/openlocate-server)\r\n\r\nCode Review\r\n[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5538c805e30ba04c29000785/badges/8c01c787a5291ebf13bf/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/repos/5538c805e30ba04c29000785/feed)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
